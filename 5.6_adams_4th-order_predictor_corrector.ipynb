The maximum number of cells that can be supported is $K$, and $α$ is constant related to the proliferative ability of the cells. In a particular type of cancer, $α = 0.0439, k = 12000$, and $t$ is measured in months. At the time($t=0$) the tumor is detected, $N(0)=4000$. Using the Adams predictor-corrector method with $h=0.5$, find the number of months it takes for $N(t) = 11000$ cells, which is the lethal number of cells for this cancer."],"metadata":{"id":"gTI2_5x4ahdN"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def AB_Predictor_Corrector(def_fn, a, b, ya, N):\n","    f = def_fn          #intakes function to method to approximate \n","    h = (b-a)/N         #creates step size based on input values of a, b, N \n","    t = np.arange(a, b+h, h) #array intialized to hold mesh points t\n","    y = np.zeros((N+1,)) #array to hold Midpoint Method approximated y values\n","    y[0] = ya           #intial condition \n","    \n","    #using RK4 to obtain the first 3 points\n","    for i in range(0,N):\n","        if i in range(0,3):\n","            k1 = h * f(t[i],y[i])\n","            k2 = h * f(t[i] + (h/2.0), y[i] +(k1/2.0))\n","            k3 = h * f(t[i] + (h/2.0), y[i] + (k2/2.0))\n","            k4 = h * f(t[i] + h, y[i] + k3)\n","        \n","            y[i + 1] = y[i] + (k1 + 2.0*k2 + 2.0*k3 + k4)/6.0\n","            \n","        else:\n","             y[i + 1] = y[i] + h*(55.0 * f(t[i],y[i]) - 59.0 * f(t[i-1],y[i-1]) + 37.0 * f(t[i-2],y[i-2]) - 9.0 * f(t[i-3],y[i-3]))/24.0\n","             y[i + 1] = y[i] + h*(9.0 * f(t[i+1], y[i + 1]) + 19.0 * f(t[i],y[i]) - 5.0 * f(t[i-1],y[i-1]) + f(t[i-2],y[i-2]))/24.0\n","    lis = []\n","    for i in range(-10, 0):\n","        lis.append((t[i], y[i]))\n","    return lis"],"metadata":{"id":"iyxhHhg0QOBV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1653921417444,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Kun Shi","userId":"02838225806016623324"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","test_f = lambda y, self: 0.0439*np.log(12000/(y+1e-9))*y\n","# because it occurs divided by 0, so we add a small number to the y at the denominator\n","AB_Predictor_Corrector(test_f, 0, 275, 4000, 550)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"27EDFCLhQR2U","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1653921534943,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":283,"user":{"displayName":"Kun Shi","userId":"02838225806016623324"}},"outputId":"a8e0d0e6-dbe1-43f7-e1bf-c41d3b79b787"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[(270.5, 10893.951176419183),\n"," (271.0, 10916.48371608758),\n"," (271.5, 10939.046881969698),\n"," (272.0, 10961.640653835108),\n"," (272.5, 10984.2650114906),\n"," (273.0, 11006.919934780048),\n"," (273.5, 11029.60540358428),\n"," (274.0, 11052.321397820939),\n"," (274.5, 11075.067897444342),\n"," (275.0, 11097.844882445359)]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]}]}
